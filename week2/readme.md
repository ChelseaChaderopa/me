TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.
exercise 0 and one were very helpful
exercise 3 was confusing and still mostly unclear, including where and when to use certain functions.
The star questions took a while to figure out and im still a little confused about how to approach future questions like these

append means "add to"
e.g star_list.append(*) = star_list including * .
